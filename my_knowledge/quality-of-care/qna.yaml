        ## Quality of Care in the Commonwealth

        The 2022 Massachusetts Aligned Measure Set is comprised of a total of 35 measures that are endorsed for use in global budget APMs, 23 of which were drawn from the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS ). This report ® includes 2022 statewide scores for 20 of the endorsed HEDIS ®  measures that are in the measure set. Some of these measures were newly collected this year, but 2020 scores are also included for 15 of the 20 measures. For most measures, a higher score is better; note that a lower score is better for HbA1c Poor Control (&gt;9%).

        Higher scores were reported in 2022 for 10 of the 15 measures with data available for both years. While many measures that require an in-person test or visit improved, performance on two screening measures-colorectal cancer and cervical cancer-declined in 2022 compared to 2020; however, it is important to note that the recommended age range for the Colorectal Cancer Screening measure changed during this time period, so lower scores are expected for 2022 as the new recommendation is implemented. Adolescent Immunizations, on the other hand, improved notably with the largest score increase observed for the measures where comparison is possible, from 28.5 in 2020 to 48.5 in 2022.

        While this chart highlights some high-level findings, CHIA will publish a full report on the Aligned Measure Set in summer 2024.

  The Massachusetts health care system faced rising costs, affordability challenges, and ongoing pandemic-related financial pressures in 2022. While insurance coverage remained strong, rising premiums, increased HDHP enrollment, and growing out-of-pocket costs posed challenges for consumers. Additionally, telehealth and behavioral health services played a growing role, even as overall utilization declined slightly from pandemic peaks.
