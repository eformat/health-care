document_outline: |
  The Massachusetts health care system faced rising costs, affordability challenges, and ongoing pandemic-related financial pressures in 2022. While insurance coverage remained strong, rising premiums, increased HDHP enrollment, and growing out-of-pocket costs posed challenges for consumers. Additionally, telehealth and behavioral health services played a growing role, even as overall utilization declined slightly from pandemic peaks.
