      Despite members enrolled in smaller employer plans
      paying, on average, similar or higher monthly premiums
      than members in larger employer plans, members enrolled
      through larger employer groups had more of their medical
      costs covered by their health plans. Additionally, from
      2021 to 2022, member cost-sharing increased the fastest
      for members enrolled in small (1-50 employees) and mid-
      size (51-100 employees) group plans, increasing 7.8%
      and 8.0%, respectively, representing the greatest increase
      above 2019 pre-pandemic levels.
      In 2022, over 1.7 million Massachusetts contract members,
      representing 42.4% of the commercial market, were
      enrolled in a high deductible health plan (HDHP). Per
      federal IRS rules, a HDHP is defined as a plan with a
      deductible greater than or equal to $1,400. The enrollment
      increase in 2022 continued long-term growth trends in
      HDHPs, which have experienced enrollment more than
      double since 2014 when only 19.0% of members were
      enrolled in HDHPs. Unsubsidized individual purchasers
      and members enrolled in smaller group plans had a greater
      prevalence of HDHP enrollment, with 90% of unsubsidized
      individual purchasers and more than two-thirds of small
      and mid-size group members enrolled in HDHPs.

      Telehealth allows patients to receive medical care remotely through phone,
      video, or online platforms. This can increase access to healthcare
      services, especially for those living in rural or underserved areas by providing
      them with the opportunity to receive medical care remotely, reducing the need for
      lengthy travel to healthcare facilities. The use of telehealth has increased
      significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, as many healthcare providers
      and patients have turned to remote consultations to minimize the risk of transmission.
      According to Massachusetts Health Policy Commission, the top conditions treated
      via telehealth in 2022 included chronic conditions such as diabetes,
      hypertension, and asthma, as well as mental health conditions like anxiety and depression.
      In Massachusetts, effective January 1, 2021, Chapter 260 of the Acts of 2020
      mandated telehealth payment parity, requiring telehealth services to be reimbursed
      at the same rate as in-person services. Specifically, it required payment parity for
      behavioral health services in perpetuity; for certain primary care and chronic
      disease management services through January 1, 2023; and for all other services through
      90 days after the end of the state of emergency. The Health Policy Commission’s Telehealth Use
      in the Commonwealth and Policy Recommendations showed telehealth utilization peaked
      in April of 2020, representing nearly 70% of primary care, specialist, and behavioral health
      visits. Throughout the remainder of 2020, the proportion of primary care and
      specialist-provided care delivered via telehealth declined, while the proportion
      of behavioral health visits provided via telehealth remained high.

      APTC is a federal tax credit available to individuals and families with
      incomes below 400% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) who enroll in plans
      sold on the Health Connector. The purpose of the APTC is to help individuals
      and families with incomes below 400% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) afford health
      insurance premiums by providing them with a federal tax credit.
      This credit can be applied directly to premiums or paid as a lump sum as part of the member's tax return.
      The Affordable Premium Tax Credit (APTC) provides eligible individuals
      and families with a federal tax credit based on income and family size.
      The credit can be applied to monthly premiums or claimed as a lump sum on tax returns.
      Depending on income and other eligibility factors, qualifying Massachusetts residents
      may purchase ConnectorCare plans that include state cost-sharing reduction (CSR) subsidies
      and premium subsidies, as well as federal Advance Premium Tax Credits (APTCs).
      Other members who earn too much to qualify for ConnectorCare plans may still receive APTCs
      based on federal affordability standards; they are identified as APTC-only throughout this chapter.
      While the vast majority of private commercial members are covered under employer-sponsored insurance (ESI),
      some individuals purchase plans for themselves and their families via the Health Connector, through intermediaries
      or directly from insurers. In this report, these members are referred to as
      “individual purchasers.” APTC-only members were grouped under unsubsidized individual purchasers
      throughout this report, unless otherwise noted.

      ASO commercial payers provide administrative services for self-insured employers,
      including plan design, network access, claims adjudication, and population health management.
      The primary benefit of using an ASO for self-insured employers is that it allows them to outsource administrative tasks,
      such as plan design and claims administration, to a third-party administrator,
      freeing up internal resources for other business activities.
      When using an ASO, self-insured employers typically have limited ability
      to choose their own network providers. Commercial payers that perform administrative
      services for self-insured employers. Services can include plan design and network access,
      claims adjudication and administration, and/or population health management.
      Health insurance premiums are set prospectively based on historical data and projected
      growth in claims and administrative costs. Premium revenues are used to cover member health
      care expenses (i.e., claims costs), as well as general administrative costs (e.g., taxes, fees,
      and broker commissions; hereafter referred to as “non-medical expenses”), and contributions to surplus.
      The 2022 premiums were calculated in early 2021 using health care spending data from
      a combination of 2019 and 2020 to account for the uncertainty in trends caused by the pandemic.
      In 2022, after paying for members’ health care expenses, the funds available to health plans to
      cover non-medical expenses and contributions to surplus increased 42.9% to $77 PMPM, following a 36.0% decrease
      between 2020 and 2021.

      ACOs are groups of healthcare providers that contract with payers to assume responsibility
      for delivering care to attributed patients and improving health outcomes. The goal of
      an Accountable Care Organization (ACO) is to improve the quality of care, reduce costs, and enhance patient outcomes by
      coordinating care across different healthcare providers and settings.
      Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) receive payment through value-based contracts
      that reward them for achieving quality and cost targets, rather than traditional fee-for-service payments.
      Among MassHealth plans, Primary Care ACOs (ACO-Bs) spent the highest proportion of total spending on
      behavioral health care (17.4%), as well as the highest SUD spending of all plan types ($35 PMPM in 2022).
      In 2022, 29.3% of ACO-B members had a behavioral health diagnosis, a 1.0 percentage point decline from 2021.
      This report presents payer adherence to the Commonwealth’s recommended Aligned Measure Set in their APM
      contracts with providers. The goal of the Aligned Measure Set is to prioritize the use of meaningful quality
      measures and promote aligned accountability across payers and providers. Statewide scores on a subset of
      Aligned Measure Set measures are reported, including comparison of 2022 results with 2020 results on 14 clinical
      quality measures. For 10 of these measures, 2022 scores improved compared to 2020 scores. This report
      also includes results from the 2022 MassHealth Member Experience Survey, which was issued to samples
      of Accountable Care Organization (ACO) members in early 2022 with a recent primary care visit. Findings
      from a similar survey of members enrolled in private commercial health plans are also presented in this report,
      as well as data on hospital performance metrics including readmissions rates, patient experience ratings following
      hospital visits, maternity care, nursing workforce, and hospital adherence to hand hygiene safe practices.
