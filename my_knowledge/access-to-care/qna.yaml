      Despite members enrolled in smaller employer plans
      paying, on average, similar or higher monthly premiums
      than members in larger employer plans, members enrolled
      through larger employer groups had more of their medical
      costs covered by their health plans. Additionally, from
      2021 to 2022, member cost-sharing increased the fastest
      for members enrolled in small (1-50 employees) and mid-
      size (51-100 employees) group plans, increasing 7.8%
      and 8.0%, respectively, representing the greatest increase
      above 2019 pre-pandemic levels.
      In 2022, over 1.7 million Massachusetts contract members,
      representing 42.4% of the commercial market, were
      enrolled in a high deductible health plan (HDHP). Per
      federal IRS rules, a HDHP is defined as a plan with a
      deductible greater than or equal to $1,400. The enrollment
      increase in 2022 continued long-term growth trends in
      HDHPs, which have experienced enrollment more than
      double since 2014 when only 19.0% of members were
      enrolled in HDHPs. Unsubsidized individual purchasers
      and members enrolled in smaller group plans had a greater
      prevalence of HDHP enrollment, with 90% of unsubsidized
      individual purchasers and more than two-thirds of small
      and mid-size group members enrolled in HDHPs.
