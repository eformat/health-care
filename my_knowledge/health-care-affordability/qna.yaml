  - context: |
      Despite near universal health insurance coverage in Massachusetts, residents report challenges affording necessary health care services. To present a more
complete picture of health care costs and corresponding challenges from the consumer perspective, this new chapter combines affordability metrics across multiple CHIA data streams. Massachusetts residents face growing
health care affordability concerns due to rising healthcare costs, increased demand for health care services, and growing enrollment in high deductible health plans
(HDHPs). Metrics presented in this chapter represent some, but not all, of the financial impact of health care costs on Massachusetts residents and employers. As
policymakers and other stakeholders chart the path forward amid a changed health care landscape, healthcare affordability remains a critical consideration in
examining the performance of the Massachusetts healthcare system.
