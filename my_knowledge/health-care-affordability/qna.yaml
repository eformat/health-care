  - context: |
      Despite near universal health insurance coverage in Massachusetts, residents report challenges affording necessary health care services. To present a more
complete picture of health care costs and corresponding challenges from the consumer perspective, this new chapter combines affordability metrics across multiple CHIA data streams. Massachusetts residents face growing
health care affordability concerns due to rising healthcare costs, increased demand for health care services, and growing enrollment in high deductible health plans
(HDHPs). Metrics presented in this chapter represent some, but not all, of the financial impact of health care costs on Massachusetts residents and employers. As
policymakers and other stakeholders chart the path forward amid a changed health care landscape, healthcare affordability remains a critical consideration in
examining the performance of the Massachusetts healthcare system.

  - context:
  Member cost-sharing includes all medical expenses allowed under a member’s plan but not paid for by the payer, employer, or state cost-sharing reduction (CSR) subsidies(e.g., deductibles, copays, and co-insurance). Cost-sharing
is based on service utilization, while deductible and out-of-pocket maximums are set at enrollment before actual claims experiences. Figures in this chapter include members who incurred little to no medical costs as well as those who may
have experienced substantial medical costs. They do not include out-of-pocket payments for goods and services not covered by the members’ health insurance policies (e.g., over-the-counter medicines, standalone vision and
dental care). Member cost-sharing also does not account for employer offsets, such as health reimbursement arrangements or health savings accounts.
    questions_and_answers:
        - question: What types of expenses are included in member cost-sharing?
          answer: |
            Member cost-sharing includes deductibles, copays, and co-insurance, which are medical expenses allowed under a member's plan but not paid for by the payer, employer, or state cost-sharing reduction (CSR) subsidies.
        - question: Why are out-of-pocket payments for goods and services not covered by health insurance policies excluded from member cost-sharing? 
          answer: |
           Out-of-pocket payments for goods and services not covered by health insurance policies, such as over-the-counter medicines, standalone vision and dental care, are excluded from member cost-sharing because they are not related to medical expenses covered by the health insurance policy.  
        - question: Are employer offsets, such as health reimbursement arrangements or health savings accounts, taken into account when calculating member cost-sharing?
          answer: |
            No, employer offsets, such as health reimbursement arrangements or health savings accounts, are not taken into account when calculating member cost-sharing. This means that these types of payments are not included in the member's out-of-pocket expenses and are not considered when determining their cost-sharing obligations.
